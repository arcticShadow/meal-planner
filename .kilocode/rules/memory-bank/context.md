**Status**: Initial project setup - Memory Bank initialization
**Phase**: Pre-development planning
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04

## Current State
- Brand new project directory with only temp.md containing requirements
- No source code files exist yet
- Memory Bank being initialized to capture project vision and requirements
- Project requirements clearly defined in temp.md

## Immediate Focus
- Complete Memory Bank initialization with all core files
- Plan technical architecture for offline-first web application
- Define technology stack for browser-based meal planning system
- Prepare for initial development phase

## Recent Changes
- Created .kilocode/rules/memory-bank/ directory structure
- Documented project brief and product vision
- Captured detailed requirements from temp.md

## Next Steps
1. Complete architecture planning for offline database and sync system
2. Define technology stack (likely HTML/CSS/JavaScript with IndexedDB)
3. Create initial project structure with core files
4. Implement basic recipe management functionality
5. Build meal planning calendar interface
6. Develop shopping list consolidation system
7. Implement data export/import features
8. Add browser-to-browser sync capabilities

## Key Decisions Pending

- Database schema design for recipes, meals, and shopping lists
- Browser-to-browser sync protocol implementation
- UI/UX design approach for calendar and shopping list interfaces

## Important Notes
- All functionality must work completely offline
- No server dependencies allowed for core features
- Cross-browser compatibility is essential
- Mobile-responsive design required
