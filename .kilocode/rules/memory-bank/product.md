# Menu Planner - Product Vision

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Many people struggle with meal planning and grocery shopping efficiency:
- Forgetting what meals were planned for which days
- Creating duplicate or incomplete shopping lists
- Losing recipes or meal plans when switching devices
- Difficulty coordinating meal planning with family members or roommates
- Dependence on internet connectivity for meal planning apps
- Lack of control over personal recipe data

### Solution
A completely offline web application that puts users in full control of their meal planning data while providing intelligent automation for shopping list generation and meal scheduling.

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Recipe Collection**: Users build their personal recipe library by either manually entering recipes through forms or importing structured JSON files
2. **Meal Planning**: Users assign recipes to future dates using an intuitive interface that suggests the closest available dates
3. **Shopping List Generation**: The system automatically consolidates ingredients from selected meals, showing totals while maintaining traceability to specific meals and dates
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple users can sync their meal plans and recipe libraries through direct browser-to-browser communication
